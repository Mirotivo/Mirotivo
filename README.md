## Experience

### Software Engineer at Butterfly Systems (May 2023 - Nov 2024)

- In my current role, I focus on developing innovative software solutions aimed at streamlining surgery inventory management within operating theatres. This involves automating tasks such as inventory stock take and replenishment while also creating surgeon-specific file master cards. Additionally, I contribute to the development of real-time recording systems designed to automate surgical setup. My mission is to revolutionize surgical inventory management, ultimately enhancing efficiency and precision in healthcare settings.

### DL Algorithm Engineer at Cisco (Apr 2021 - Dec 2022)

- During my tenure at Cisco, I was involved in research and development efforts centered around audio algorithms. My work primarily focused on voice speech detection, noise removal, and speech enhancement using deep learning techniques.

### Algorithm Engineer at Lens Immersive (Apr 2019 - Apr 2021)

- At Lens Immersive, I played a key role in the development of the company's proprietary video codec, TORII. Additionally, I created a user-friendly web interface enabling users to encode videos using H264, H265, H266, and TORII, while also evaluating the performance of each codec.

### Software Engineer at Paxerahealth (Jun 2017 - Apr 2019)

- During my tenure at Paxerahealth, I contributed to the Radiology Information System (RIS), focusing on the management of imaging orders and billing information. I also worked on integrating the RIS with the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Furthermore, I developed a mobile Electronic Medical Records (EMR) application, CarePassport, providing patients with access to their medical records.

### Software Engineer at Medstreaming (Jan 2015 - Jun 2017)

- My role at Medstreaming centered around the development of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems for managing patient medical records and histories. These systems were seamlessly integrated into the Cardiovascular Information System (CVIS).

## Education

### Masters in Computer Science from University of New England (2023)

- My master's research was centered on cutting-edge technology, specifically utilizing RetinaNet for Snow Leopard Detection. This involved harnessing the power of computer vision and deep learning to develop a system capable of accurately identifying and tracking these elusive creatures.

### Masters in Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University (2020)

- During my master's program, I delved deep into the realm of advanced technologies by conducting research on Emotion Recognition by Facial Features. My work revolved around leveraging state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and interpret facial expressions. I utilized the BioVid Emo DB, a resource published by Ulm University, to refine and advance the capabilities of emotion recognition systems.

### Bachelors in Telecommunications Engineering from El Shorouk Academy (2013)

- During my bachelor's program, I successfully designed and implemented an IPTV system using C# and Silverlight, delivering television content over IP networks. This involved tasks such as setting up a streaming server, managing databases, implementing user authentication, and creating an intuitive Silverlight client application for content access.
